# Clustering_Renyi_Entropy
Implementation of a Clustering Algorithm based on Renyi's entropy of clusters, in R. A pptx presentation of the algorithm and results included.

Algorithm based on : http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~erdogmus/publications/C043_IJCNN2003_RenyiClustering_Robert.pdf
Iris and Wine dataset from ICI repository used.
All algorithm's functions are coded in seperate script.

Joined effort of Foudoyli Anastasia and Kofterou Maria.
